							<h2>Product Experience</h2>
							<p>Throughout his career Liam has developed a strong familiarity with the payment and money movement space. Payments are an interesting challenge for a PM. On top of the traditional juggling act of user needs, technical feasibility and development time, payments add the additional complexity of stringent regulatory requirements. Liam thoroughly enjoys the difficulty of balancing these four needs to deliver exceptional user experiences.</p>

						<h2>Gavel</h2>
						<h3>Winning solution of the 2019 Idealab case study challenge</h3>
						<p>The vast majority of Gen Z use some sort of P2P payment solution on their phones. Gavel fills a currently unoccupied niche within this space. What can be dubbed the P2S, Peer to Stranger, space. With a conventional P2P payment platform once money is exchanged it is difficult to ensure both parties live up to the terms of their agreement. Gavel combined 3 concepts to drastically reduce this transaction risk.</p>
